# Green Screen Remover
This is an C# application which can be used to remove green background. You can choose between C++ and Assembly DLL library. The application supports multi-threading, which means you can choose the number of threads to work with. To change the "intensity" of removing the green color, change the value of the threshold value slider. When the algorithm finishes its work, you will receive an information about how long it took to edit the photo. Of course you can save your edited photo.

## Remember!!!
Before running a code remember to add DLL libraries to the right place (where .exe is located or change the file path in MainWindow.xaml.cs file).
